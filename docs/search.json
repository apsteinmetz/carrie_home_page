    "text": "A Message from the Birthday Girl:\nDearest people to me,\nThank you for being there for me all these years; all these years that don’t seem possible to be passing by so quickly. It’s now almost 2024, and some of us haven’t been together in over a year or more, even if it feels like yesterday - it wasn’t! You are so present in my heart and how I think about you so often for inspiration, laugh at our crazy times, and wonder how in the world we have made it this point given those crazy times! My biggest wish to celebrate walking around the sun for a half-century would be to spend some time together, connect with you more frequently and to tell you how important each of you are to me (ok that’s 3 wishes but..). So, whether the timing of this one celebration works for you or not given all the hectic schedules, let’s plan some time to celebrate:) For folks who have an opening in March, let’s get our Island on! Love you all and so looking forward to seeing each of you whenever possible.\n\nLove, Carrie\n\n\n\nA Message from the Host:\nWe are so happy to invite you to (Carrie’s version of) paradise to enjoy some sun, sand, surf, reggae, food, drinks, good people, …. Oh and a Birthday! We will get you down to paradise and have a place to rest (if you don’t just end up sleeping on the beach!), but we please need your HELP with the following:\n\n\nHELP - Things You Have to Do\nCarrie is providing the hotel, transportation and some fabulous meals and activities, but you still have to do a few things:\n\n1. Block out the dates March 22-26.\n\n\n2. IMPORTANT - Fill Out This Form ASAP:\n\nTo reserve a seat on the private jet you must enter your personal and passport info HERE. Where it asks hotel reservation number enter N/A. The departure airport is “HPN” and the arrival is “AXA” Round trip, of course. For passenger email, use “carebearnyc@gmail.com.” We can’t reserve your seat on the private jet until this form is submitted!\n\n\n\n3. Arrange transportation to Westchester County Airport on March 22.\n\nMore to come on this - if there is a NYC crew maybe we will Sprinter up together?\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Check back on this site for updates\n\nThis is party central.\nCarrie will continue to put (or ask me to put) fun tidbits of the Anguilla excursions you can opt into, if you are able to get out of the gorgeous water!\n\n\n\n\nThings to Get You Excited About Anguilla\nThe Aurora Anguilla Resort\nThe Moonsplash Reggae Festival\nCarrie’s Happy Place\n\n\nJimmy Buffet and Bankie Banx Jam at Dune Preserve\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare your questions, thoughts and lavish praise for Carrie below. Do not put any personal information in the comments."
